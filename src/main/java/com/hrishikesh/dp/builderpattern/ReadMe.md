# Builder Design Pattern
## Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
 - Builder pattern is used to create objects that made from a bunch of other obejcts 
 - It hides the creation of the parts from client
 - The builder only knows the specification of object creation, nobody else
