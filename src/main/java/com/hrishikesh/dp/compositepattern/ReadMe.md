# Composite Design Pattern
    - Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies.
    - Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
    - Recursive composition
    - Example: "Directories contain entries, each of which could be a directory or file."
